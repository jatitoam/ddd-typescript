# DDD for Typescript

## What is this?

This repository intends to implement the architectural classes for any project that wants to base on [Eric Evan's Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321125215&linkCode=as2&tag=martinfowlerc-20).

## How is this organized

This project is organized in main directories, considering each of the base objects of DDD:

- Aggregates
- Builders
- Entities
- Factories
- Repositories
- Services
- ValueObjects

And additionally, some infrastructural objects:

- Errors
- Contracts (mainly for repositories)

## Alpha version

This is still alpha software, not completely functional, however if for some reason you found this and you think it's a promising project, feel free to collaborate by either [Suggesting something](https://github.com/jatitoam/ddd-typescript/issues/new) or simply clone it and send a pull request.
